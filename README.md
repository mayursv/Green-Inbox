# Green-Inbox

This is a chrome extension built to automatically delete(moves to trash) selected emails after some days(30, by default). It adds unread emails to queue for deletion automatically
and removes them when user reads the email, or keeps them if email is unread. User also has the option to add or remove email to/from deletion queue. 

This chrome extension not only helps people keep their inbox clean and reduce storage, but also helps to reduce the carbon footprint produced from storing unrequired emails. It is 
estimated that - "In a year, an average person in the developed world adds 136kg of CO2 to their carbon footprint from the emails they send and receive". So by deleting unrequired
emails this extension helps reduce carbon footprint. Hence is the name of this extension "Green Inbox". 

## Features
- Handles logging in and out of multiple google accounts.
- Keeps your emails in sync if you have multiple devices
- Automatically handles scheduling unread mails.
